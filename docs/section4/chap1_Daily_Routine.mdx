applied once every five or eight days for stimulating secretion.</li>
				<li>Notes: “vision is predominant in P, hence it is
particularly susceptible to K; the measures alleviating K are beneficial for clarifying the vision.”</li>
				<li>[confirm this statement in Charaka.]</li>
				<li>“A sharp collyrium should not be applied at day,
because the vision already weak due to evacuation is further depressed by the sun; evacuative collyrium should be applied only at night.</li>
