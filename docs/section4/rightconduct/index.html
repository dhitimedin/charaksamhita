The stability of life-span of all living beings depends on their personal daiva and purusakara.</p><p>2 Factors effecting Life-span:
Daiva: deed self-done in the previous life
Purusakara: deed self-done in the present life</p><p>The 3 Grades of Daiva and Purusakara:</p><ul><li><em>Superior Daiva and Superior Purusakara</em> together results in a long, happy
and ‚Äòdetermined‚Äô [semi-guaranteed to be long] life-span.</li><li><em>Inferior Daiva and Inferior Purusakara</em> together result in a short, unhappy
and un-determined [no guarantee on continued life or strength] life-span.</li><li><em>Medium grade Daiva and Medium grade Purusakara</em> result in a medium life-span, moderate happiness and somewhat-determined life-span.</li></ul><p>Relevant Dominance:
Weak Daiva may be subdued by Purusakara (which is stronger). But by distinguished Daiva, Purusakara is subdued.</p><p>Method of attaining the desired life-span:</p><ul><li>The great sages try to obtain the desired life-span by penance. </li><li>Wholesome regimen is the basis of life; contrary is that of death.</li></ul><p>Timely Death:
An axle fitted in a vehicle which is endowed with all the natural quantities carries on and perishes in time by depreciation of it‚Äôs normal limit; similarly, the life-span in a body of a person having strong constitution and managed properly gets it‚Äôs end and loss of its normal limit. Such death is known as timely. On the other hand, the same axle gets destroyed in the way due to overload, uneven road, want of road, breaking of wheels, defects in vehicle or driver, separation of the bolt, non-lubrication and throwing about, similarly the life-span comes to end in the middle.</p><p>The life-span in a body of a person having strong constitution and managed
properly gets it‚Äôs end and loss at it‚Äôs normal limit (100 years).</p><p>Causes of untimely death:
Life-span comes to an end in the middle due to over-exertion, diet not in accordance with agni, irregular meals, complicated body postures, over-indulgence in intercourse, company of ignoble persons, suppression of impelled urges, non-suppression of suppressible urges, infliction with organisms, poisonous winds and fire, injury and avoidance of food and medicaments. Also due to fever etc. due to faulty management.</p><p>Argument Against Pre-determined Life-span:
[...Weak daiva is subdued by the stronger purusakara. Likewise, by the distinguished daiva purusakara is subdued...] Observing this some hold the determined span of life, but, in fact, some superior deeds exhibit results determined in time while others have such determination in time. This is known by observation.</p><p>Hence because both types of causes are observed one-sided view is not correct. I
will explain it with examples. If there be determined life-span for all there would not be any necessity to apply mantras, herb-roots, gems, auspicious rites, offerings, gifts, oblations, observance of rules, expiation, fasting, blessings, bowing, visit to temples etc. with a desire for longevity nor there be any need to avoid excited, fierce and moving cows, elephants, camels, asses, horses, buffalo and terrific winds etc. Likewise, one would not abstain from water falls, mountains, uneven and difficult places and strong water current, from careless, insane, excited, fierce and unstable persons and those inflicted with confusion and greed; from enemies, from furious fire, from various poisonous reptiles, serpents etc. from over-exertion, from behavior unsuited to place and time, and from king‚Äôs wrath, because these and other similar factors should not be destructive because of entire life having been determined span. Moreover, the living beings who have not practiced the alleviative measures against the happening of untimely death should not be subjected to such happening; all the talks of great sages for initiation and knowledge of application in the chapter of rasayana [Chikitsasthana; in context of treatment of specific diseases] would be useless; even Indra should not be able to kill with thunderbolt his enemy with determined life-span; why should Aswins treat the patient with therapeutic measure? Why should the great sages try to obtain the desired life-span by penance? It would also not be necessary for the great sages along with the lord of the gods (Indra), who already know all that is worth knowing, to ses, to instruct and to behave properly.</p><p>Excellent among all the visions is the one pertaining to Indra, which is possessed by us as well, with this it is observed like this‚Äì there is dissimilarity in life-span of thousands of persons who are those not indulged in fighting battles; similarly in those who counteract or do not counteract the disease immediately after it is arisen; there is also dissimilarity in life-span of those who take poison or not; there is no similar fate of the jars carrying water and those in pictures (or kept only for decoration). Hence wholesome regimen is the basis of life and the contrary is that of death. Over and above, orderly and proper use of food and activities which are contrary to the properties of place, time and self, abstaining from excessive, negative and perverted use in respect of all (time, action and senses), holding up of psychic excesses (emotions), non-suppression of natural impelled urges, avoidance of over-exertion we take these as the cause for continuance of health and accordingly also instruct and observe properly.</p><p>(on Life-span):</p><p>My view on existence and non-existence of timely and untimely death is like
this‚Äì some say whoever dies does so in time because there is no gap in time. This is not correct as there is no point in discussion about the gap or otherwise with regard to time because time has got its own characters due to nature. Others say‚Äì when somebody dies is his fixed death time. Death is true for all beings because of equal dealing. This also is wrong interpretation of fact. Equal dealing does not mean that there is none who does not die. The present context is the time which relates to the span of life. If one holds that the time when somebody dies is the time of death for him, then according to this all entities would be determined in respect of time but this is not correct because it is observed that the result of untimely food, speech and action is harmful otherwise useful. Moreover, there is clear usage of ‚Äútime‚Äù and ‚Äúun-time‚Äù in relation to different conditions and entities such as‚Äì this is the time or not for this disease, food, medicament, therapy and remission. Even in common usage they say- it rains timely or untimely, this cold weather is timely or untimely, that heat spell is untimely or untimely, flowering and fruiting of plants is happening in time or otherwise and so on. Hence both are true‚Äì timely death and untimely death. There is no scope for any exclusive view. If there be no untimely death and all would have determined life-span, then in that case there would not be any purpose of the knowledge of the wholesome and the un-wholesome. Over and above, perception, inference and testimony would not be recognized as means of valid knowledge which are recognized as such in all the scriptures and which provide knowledge about the factors conducive or otherwise to life-span. Therefore, the sages hold the view that there is no untimely death is only a jugglery of words.</p><p>During this age [[referring to one of the ‚ÄúYugas‚Äù from a millennium-scale
calendar. These are mentioned in section on ‚Äúinitial occurrence of diseases‚Äù, and perhaps described further in the Vedas.]], the normal life-span is 100 years.</p><p>This depend on excellence of constitution, body constituents, the self along with
the use of suitable things.</p></div></article><div class="margin-vert--xl"><div class="row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/edit/master/website/docs/section4/chap2_Right_Conduct.mdx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><svg fill="currentColor" height="1.2em" width="1.2em" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet" viewBox="0 0 40 40" style="margin-right:0.3em;vertical-align:sub"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div></div></div><div class="margin-vert--lg"><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/charaksamhita/docs/"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">¬´ Daily Routine</div></a></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/charaksamhita/docs/section4/codeofgoodconduct"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Code of Good Conduct ¬ª</div></a></div></nav></div></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_3SO_"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#qualities-of-the-normal-people" class="table-of-contents__link">Qualities of the normal people:</a></li><li><a href="#people-to-avoid" class="table-of-contents__link">People to Avoid:</a></li><li><a href="#qualities-of-the-wise" class="table-of-contents__link">Qualities of the wise:</a></li><li><a href="#people-to-keep-company-with" class="table-of-contents__link">People to keep company with:</a></li><li><a href="#instructions-for-health-balanced-dhatus-in-a-nut-shell" class="table-of-contents__link">Instructions for Health (Balanced Dhatus), In a Nut Shell:</a></li><li><a href="#wrong-action" class="table-of-contents__link">Wrong Action:</a></li><li><a href="#unhealthy-urges-which-should-be-suppressed" class="table-of-contents__link">Unhealthy Urges which should be suppressed:</a></li><li><a href="#eliminating-bad-habits" class="table-of-contents__link">Eliminating Bad Habits:</a></li><li><a href="#program-to-avoid-disease" class="table-of-contents__link">PROGRAM TO AVOID DISEASE:</a></li><li><a href="#more-right-conduct" class="table-of-contents__link">More Right Conduct:</a><ul><li><a href="#3-sub-pillars-of-life" class="table-of-contents__link">3 Sub-pillars (of life):</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#best-actions-chart" class="table-of-contents__link">Best Actions Chart:</a></li><li><a href="#attaining-the-full-life-span" class="table-of-contents__link">Attaining the Full Life-Span:</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="text--center"><div>Copyright ¬© 2020 Dhiti, Inc.</div></div></div></footer></div>
